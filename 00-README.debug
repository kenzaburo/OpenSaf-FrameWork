Troubleshooting OpenSAF
======================

System Controller Checklist
===========================

1.  Did TIPC installation fail? The following error "FATAL: Error inserting 
    tipc (<kernel_modules_dir>/tipc.ko): Invalid module format" indicates that 
    user had not compiled TIPC with proper kernel files. Compile TIPC with 
    appropriate kernel header files (e.g. They are different for an smp kernel 
    type, etc.)

2.  Have you checked the TIPC configuration? The following TIPC configuration 
    parameters should be set appropriately in nodeinit.conf:

    a. TIPC network_id should be the same as ACTIVE system controller's 
       network_id.
    b. The interface information is set with default values. This has 
       to be set correctly to ensure connectivity between the system 
       controller and payload nodes.
       Also, the TIPC zone_id and cluster_id values are currently hard-coded.
       These have to be checked for correctness as below if zone_id and 
       cluster_id are changed:
    c. zone_id should be the same as ACTIVE system controller's zone_id.
    d. cluster_id should be the same as ACTIVE system controller's cluster_id.

3.  Have you checked the slot_id?
    The slot_id should be unique and different from any other node. The system 
    controllers.

4.  Have you checked the open source packages installation?
    Ensure that the following open source packages are installed
    (make install or the rpm packages are installed):

    The configure process should have detected the presence or absence of
    those packages at runtime.

    a. The libxml2 libraries are available and libxml2 include files are 
       available. In cases of rpm installation, make sure the devel package 
       is installed.

5.  Have you checked the chassis_id? The chassis_id should be the same as 
    ACTIVE system controller.

6.  Have you checked the node_name. It should contain the same name as the
    value specified in the nodes.cfg file while generating the imm.xml.
    "Unconfigured CLM nodes are not allowed to join the cluster if the node_names
     dont match and CLMNA will not allowed to be initialized".

NOTE: Also check for /var/log/messages for any errors during the startup.

Payload Node Checklist
======================

1.  Did TIPC installation fail? The following error "FATAL: Error inserting 
    tipc (<kernel_modules_dir>/tipc.ko): Invalid module format" indicates that 
    user had not compiled TIPC with proper kernel files. Compile TIPC with 
    appropriate kernel header files (e.g. They are different for an smp kernel 
    type, etc.)

2.  Have you checked the TIPC configuration?
    The following TIPC configuration parameters should be set appropriately 
    in nodeinit.conf:

    a. TIPC Network id should be the same as system controllers's network ID.
    b. The interface information is set with default values. This has to be 
       set correctly to ensure connectivity between the payload and system 
       controller nodes.
       Also, the TIPC zone_id and cluster_id values are currently hardcoded. 
       These have to be checked for correctness as below if zone_id and 
       cluster_id are changed:
    c. zone_id should be the same as the system controllers's zone_id.
    d. cluster_id should be the same as the system controllers's cluster_id.

3.  Have you checked the chassis_id? The chassis_id should be the same as 
    ACTIVE & STANDBY system controllers.

4.  Have you checked the node_name. It should contain the same name as the
    value specified in the nodes.cfg file while generating the imm.xml.
    "Unconfigured CLM nodes are not allowed to join the cluster if the node_names
     dont match and CLMNA will not allowed to be initialized".


NOTE: Also check for /var/log/messages for any errors during the startup.
